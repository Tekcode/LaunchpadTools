LaunchpadTools Alpha Release
==============

This program is written in C# and allows you to control the Tiva C Launchpad, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino from a windows PC if the device is enabled to use this software. 

Known Bugs:
- You must open the serial window before you connect to the COM port to interact with the serial monitor.
- Under COM Settings, the COM port does not automatically load in the dropdown list, even though the COM port is selected in the settings.
- The serial data selection mode dropdown does not save the default position.
